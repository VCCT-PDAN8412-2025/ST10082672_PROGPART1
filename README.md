This project uses TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and Python to conduct sentiment analysis to categorize movie reviews as either good or negative.   The project covers every phase of feature selection, data preparation, and exploratory data analysis, including word clouds displaying frequently used phrases, sentiment distribution, and review length visualization.  The Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function were used to train the final model, which includes dense layers for binary classification, an embedding layer, and an LSTM layer with dropout to prevent overfitting.  Reliable generalization was confirmed by the model's good validation accuracy and balanced precision.  Performance was interpreted using evaluation measures.  This project shows that I can train and assess a deep learning model, clean and analyze huge text data, and clearly convey results through code and visual outputs.
